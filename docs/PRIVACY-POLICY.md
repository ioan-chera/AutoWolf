# AutoWolf for Android Privacy Policy
The AutoWolf application for the Android operating system does not connect to the internet for any purpose. It does not collect any user identifiable data.

## Game Data Files
AutoWolf requires the user to provide a set of data files (henceforth "data files") which come bundled with the DOS version of the id Software game Wolfenstein 3-D, the id Software game Spear of Destiny, or any derived material with compatible format. These files are not included with the AutoWolf application. Without those files provided, AutoWolf will not start beyond the opening screen. User must legally obtain the DATA FILES along with the complete original game package before they can use them, then they must transfer them into the device, on the file storage. Guidelines are provided inside the AutoWolf application on the requirements to start beyond the opening screen.

AutoWolf is capable of searching for the DATA FILES on user's external file storage. This storage does NOT include private application storage for any app.

If any full matches are found, they will be listed for the user to choose. AutoWolf does NOT use ANY OTHER file information besides the matching DATA FILES found. To find a full match, AutoWolf needs to find the following files inside a single folder: AUDIOHED.XYZ, AUDIOT.XYZ, GAMEMAPS.XYZ, MAPHEAD.XYZ, VGADICT.XYZ, VGAGRAPH.XYZ, VGAHEAD.XYZ, VSWAP.XYZ, where XYZ can be substituded by any string which must be equal for all these names.

## Local Data Storage
AutoWolf does use the local application storage on user's device to store the following information:
1. Application settings, including: input settings, video settings, audio settings.
2. Saved game state: voluntary user saving of game state by using a typical "Save Game" user interface.
3. Application state, for recovery in case of background termination.
4. Game bot memory: as AutoWolf is run with the actual DATA FILES, it stores information it can learn strictly from what the DATA FILES provide.

NONE of this information is shared on the internet, none of it is synchronized between multiple devices, and the user is never asked to log in to any cloud service. ALL of this information is stored in application's local private internal storage, which can be deleted by user by accessing the AutoWolf application settings in the common system settings app.
